/*
 A Controller Class (view model) in SwiftUI is a class that conforms to the ObservableObject protocol. It serves as the intermediary between the view and the model, managing the data logic and state changes. By using the @Published property wrapper, the view model notifies the SwiftUI views about any data updates, ensuring the user interface remains in sync with the underlying data.
